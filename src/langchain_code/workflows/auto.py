DEEP AUTOPILOT — SILENT, END-TO-END
You already have the tools. Execute autonomously and produce exactly one final message beginning with `FINAL:`.

### Strict behavior
- No questions, no permission checks, no “next step” narration.
- Use tools for every fact; never assume.
- Do NOT emit `FINAL:` until you have real, recent tool outputs that prove the work.

### Silent operating loop (adapt as needed)
1) Scope & discovery
   - Try: run_cmd("git diff --name-only")  (even if empty, proceed)
   - Map repo: glob("**/*")
   - Find docs: glob("docs/**/*.md"); read_file("README.md") if exists
   - Find deep agent code semantically: grep("(create_deep_agent|DeepAgentState|SubAgent|task\\()", "src")
   - If external facts are needed, use TavilySearch.

2) Read what matters
   - Use read_file only on targets discovered above (changed files, deep-agent files, relevant docs).
   - Extract exact details (parameters, tools wired, CLI flags, env, flows).

3) Edit / create docs
   - Small updates → edit_by_diff; new/large pages → write_file (e.g., docs/agent/deep.md).
   - Cover: overview, architecture, tools, autopilot behavior, CLI usage (--mode deep, --auto, --apply, --llm), env/MCP config, (optional) checkpointing.
   - Re-read changed files to verify.

4) Execute / verify
   - Use run_cmd for builds/tests/linters (`{TEST_CMD}` expands if configured).
   - Capture exit codes + short stdout/stderr excerpts. If something fails, try a reasonable fallback and continue.

5) Version control (attempt-first)
   - run_cmd("git add -A")
   - run_cmd('git commit -m "docs: deep agents (autoupdate)"')  (ok if no changes)
   - run_cmd("git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD") → run_cmd(f"git push -u origin <branch>")
   - Include push stderr/stdout and exit code in the final report (even on failure).

6) Optional subagents
   - For focused research/critique: task(description=<spec+deliverables>, subagent_type="<available>"); integrate results.

7) TODO tracking (internal only)
   - Begin with write_todos([...]).
   - Keep exactly one item in_progress; mark completed immediately when done.
   - Append follow-ups as discovered.
   - Do NOT print TODOs until FINAL.

### Failure handling
- If any tool errors, adapt (fallback tool/path) and continue. Never block the entire task on one failure (including push).

### Mandatory self-audit BEFORE FINAL
You must have, in THIS run:
- ≥1 discovery/read action (glob/grep/read_file) with concrete results AND
- ≥1 command execution (run_cmd) related to git/tests/linters
If not satisfied, keep working—`FINAL:` is not allowed yet.

### Final output (single message only)
Start with `FINAL:` then include, in order, concise sections grounded in tool outputs:
- Completed TODOS with statuses
- Files changed (path list; annotate new/edited/deleted)
- Important command outputs (short) — key stdout/stderr lines + exit codes (e.g., commit/push, tests)
- Follow-ups/blockers — what remains, why, and the next concrete action
