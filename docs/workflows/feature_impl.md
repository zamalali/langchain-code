# Feature Implementation Workflow

This workflow provides a detailed guide for using the agent to implement new features based on user requests. It outlines the recommended steps and tools to ensure a structured and efficient development process, ensuring that the agent follows a consistent and well-defined approach to feature implementation. This workflow is designed to help developers leverage the power of the agent to accelerate the development process while maintaining code quality and stability.

## `FEATURE_INSTR`

This section details the `FEATURE_INSTR` instruction seed, which is provided to the ReAct agent to specialize its behavior for feature implementation tasks. This instruction seed defines a clear, step-by-step process that the agent should follow, providing a structured framework for the agent to approach feature implementation in a consistent and predictable manner. The `FEATURE_INSTR` instruction seed is designed to guide the agent through the key stages of feature development, from initial planning to final verification.

1.  **Plan:** The agent begins by carefully considering the necessary steps to implement the feature. This includes identifying the files that may need to be inspected, understanding the scope of the required changes, and formulating a high-level plan of action. This planning phase is crucial for ensuring a focused and efficient implementation process, as it allows the agent to anticipate potential challenges, allocate resources effectively, and minimize the risk of errors. A well-defined plan serves as a roadmap for the entire feature implementation process.
2.  **Locate:** The agent utilizes file system tools such as `glob` and `grep` to locate the relevant code files and identify specific code sections that need modification. `glob` is used for pattern-based file searching, allowing the agent to quickly identify files that match a given naming pattern or reside in a specific directory. `grep`, on the other hand, is employed to find specific text or code snippets within files, enabling the agent to pinpoint the exact locations where changes need to be made. These tools provide the agent with the ability to efficiently navigate and search the codebase, saving time and effort in the process.
3.  **Inspect:** The agent employs the `read_file` tool to thoroughly examine the existing code in the identified files. This step is crucial for gaining a deep understanding of the current implementation, including its architecture, dependencies, and coding style. By carefully reviewing the existing code, the agent can ensure that any modifications are made in a compatible and well-informed manner, minimizing the risk of introducing conflicts or breaking existing functionality. This step also allows the agent to identify potential areas for improvement or refactoring.
4.  **Edit:** The agent makes targeted changes to the code using the `edit_by_diff` tool. This tool allows for precise and controlled modifications by replacing specific code snippets with new ones, ensuring that only the necessary changes are made to the codebase. For the creation of entirely new files, the `write_file` tool is used. However, `edit_by_diff` is generally preferred due to its safety features and ability to generate reviewable diffs, minimizing the risk of introducing errors and facilitating code review. The `edit_by_diff` tool provides a clear and auditable record of all changes made to the code, making it easier to track down and resolve any issues that may arise.
5.  **Verify:** If a test command has been provided via the `--test-cmd` option, the agent executes it using the `run_cmd` tool, with the `{TEST_CMD}` placeholder replaced by the actual test command. This step allows the agent to automatically verify the correctness and stability of the implemented feature by running the project's test suite, ensuring that the new feature integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase and does not introduce any regressions or unexpected behavior. The agent analyzes the output of the test command to determine if the tests have passed successfully, providing a reliable indication of the feature's quality and stability.
6.  **Summarize:** The agent concludes the feature implementation workflow by providing a concise summary of all the changes made to the codebase. This summary should highlight the key modifications, explain the reasoning behind them, and suggest any potential next steps or areas for further improvement. This final step ensures that the changes are well-documented and easily understood by other developers, facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing within the development team. The summary should also include any relevant context or considerations that may be helpful for future maintenance or enhancements of the feature.
