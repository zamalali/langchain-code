# Memory

The memory module is responsible for managing the agent's memory and context. This includes storing past interactions, summarizing conversations, and providing relevant information to the agent when needed.

## Key Components

- **Conversation History:** Stores the full history of interactions between the user and the agent.
- **Summarization:** Summarizes long conversations to fit within the context window of the language model.
- **Entity Extraction:** Extracts key entities and concepts from the conversation to build a knowledge base.

## Usage

The memory module is automatically integrated with the agent and does not require separate initialization.
