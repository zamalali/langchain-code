# Deep Agent Workflow

This document outlines the workflow logic of the deep agents codebase.

## Overview

Deep agents are designed to perform complex tasks autonomously.  They leverage a combination of tools and subagents to achieve their goals. The core workflow involves:

1. **Task Definition:** A task is defined with a clear description and any necessary parameters.
2. **Tool Selection:** The agent selects the appropriate tools based on the task requirements.
3. **Subagent Launch (Optional):** If the task is complex, the agent may launch a subagent to handle a specific part of the task.
4. **Tool Execution:** The selected tools are executed, and their outputs are collected.
5. **Output Integration:** The agent integrates the outputs from the tools to produce a final result.
6. **Result Delivery:** The final result is delivered to the user.

## Code Structure

The codebase is structured as follows:

- `create_deep_agent`: Function to create a new deep agent instance.
- `DeepAgentState`: Class representing the state of a deep agent.
- `SubAgent`: Class representing a subagent.
- `task`: Function to launch a subagent.

## Example

```python
# Create a new deep agent
agent = create_deep_agent()

# Define a task
task_description = "Write a documentation for deep agents"

# Execute the task
agent.execute(task_description)
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more sophisticated tool selection logic.
- Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- Develop more advanced subagent capabilities.
