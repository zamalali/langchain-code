# Deep Agents: Autonomous Task Execution

This document provides an overview of the Deep Agents codebase, detailing its capabilities and usage.

## Overview

Deep Agents are designed for autonomous execution of complex tasks. They utilize a combination of tools and subagents to achieve their objectives. The core workflow is as follows:

1. **Task Definition:** A task is defined with a clear description and any necessary parameters.
2. **Tool Selection:** The agent intelligently selects appropriate tools based on task requirements.
3. **Subagent Launch (Optional):** For complex tasks, the agent can launch subagents to handle specific subtasks.
4. **Tool Execution:** Selected tools are executed, and their outputs are collected.
5. **Output Integration:** The agent integrates tool outputs to generate a final result.
6. **Result Delivery:** The final result is delivered.

## Capabilities

- **Autonomous Task Execution:** Handles complex tasks without human intervention.
- **Tool Orchestration:** Selects and executes appropriate tools based on task needs.
- **Subagent Management:** Launches and manages subagents for complex subtasks.
- **Output Integration:** Combines outputs from multiple tools for a coherent result.

## CLI Usage

Deep Agents can be used directly from the command line.  A typical invocation might look like this:

```bash
deepagent "Write a summary of the latest advancements in AI"
```

This command would trigger the agent to execute the specified task, leveraging its internal tools and knowledge.

## Code Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

- `create_deep_agent()`: Creates a new Deep Agent instance.
- `DeepAgentState`: Represents the internal state of a Deep Agent.
- `SubAgent`: Represents a subagent responsible for a specific task.
- `task()`: Function to launch a subagent.

## Example

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

agent = create_deep_agent()
result = agent.execute("Summarize the plot of Hamlet.")
print(result)
```

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced tool selection logic.
- Robust error handling and recovery.
- Advanced subagent capabilities.
- Improved CLI interface and options.
