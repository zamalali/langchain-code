# Deep Agent Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The Deep Agent is a modular system designed to handle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller subtasks and delegating them to specialized subagents.  This allows for flexibility, scalability, and efficient task management.

## Workflow

1. **Task Creation:** A task is received, potentially analyzed to create subtasks.
2. **Subagent Selection:** Appropriate subagents are selected based on the task.
3. **Subagent Execution:** Selected subagents execute their respective subtasks using various tools.
4. **State Management:** The `DeepAgentState` class tracks the overall state of the agent.
5. **Result Aggregation:** Results from subagents are combined to produce a final output.
6. **Optional Checkpointing:** The agent can checkpoint its state for resuming interrupted tasks.


## Subagents

The Deep Agent utilizes a collection of subagents, each specialized in a particular task.  These subagents are selected dynamically based on the input task.  Further details on individual subagents will be provided in a future update.

## State Management

The `DeepAgentState` class is crucial for managing the agent's state throughout the workflow. It tracks progress, context, and results, ensuring a consistent and reliable execution.

## Tool Integration

The Deep Agent seamlessly integrates with various tools, including file system access, shell commands, web search, and more. This allows for a wide range of capabilities.

## Checkpointing

The Deep Agent supports checkpointing, allowing for the saving and restoration of its state. This feature is particularly useful for long-running tasks, enabling the agent to resume execution after interruptions.

## Example Usage

(Example usage will be added in a future update.)
