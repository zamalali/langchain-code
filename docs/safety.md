# Safety

The safety module is responsible for ensuring that the agent's responses are safe and appropriate. It includes mechanisms for detecting and filtering harmful content, as well as providing warnings and disclaimers when necessary.

## Key Features

The safety module provides the following key features:

- **Content Filtering:** Filters out harmful or inappropriate content from the agent's responses. This includes content that is sexually suggestive, violent, or discriminatory.
- **Bias Detection:** Detects and mitigates biases in the agent's responses. This helps to ensure that the agent's responses are fair and unbiased.
- **Safety Prompts:** Provides safety-related prompts and instructions to the language model. This helps to guide the language model towards generating safe and appropriate responses.
