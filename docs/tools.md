## Tool Usage Guidelines

- Always use tools rather than guessing.
- For file edits, show exactly what changed.
- Include relevant command outputs in your response.
- Keep responses focused and actionable.

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool, you need to define a new function or class that implements the desired functionality and integrates it with the agent's tool management system.

### Best Practices

- Keep tools simple and focused.
- Provide clear and concise documentation.
- Handle errors gracefully.
- Test your tools thoroughly.
