# DeepAgents Workflow

DeepAgents is a powerful tool for automating complex workflows.  This document outlines the key steps involved in using DeepAgents effectively.

## Key Concepts

* **Agents:** Independent units responsible for specific tasks within a workflow.
* **Workflows:** Sequences of agents working together to achieve a larger goal.
* **Tasks:** Individual actions performed by agents.
* **Data Handling:** Mechanisms for agents to share data and maintain state.

## Workflow Design

1. **Define the Goal:** Clearly articulate the overall objective of the workflow.
2. **Identify Tasks:** Break down the goal into smaller, manageable tasks.
3. **Agent Selection:** Choose appropriate agents for each task, considering their capabilities and dependencies.
4. **Workflow Orchestration:** Define the order of execution for agents and how they interact.
5. **Data Flow:** Plan how data will be passed between agents.

## Workflow Execution

1. **Initialization:** Start the workflow by initiating the first agent.
2. **Task Execution:** Agents execute their assigned tasks.
3. **Data Exchange:** Agents exchange data as needed.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement mechanisms to handle potential errors and failures.
5. **Termination:** The workflow concludes when all tasks are completed successfully.

## Advanced Concepts

* **Conditional Logic:** Implement decision points based on data or events.
* **Looping:** Repeat tasks based on specific criteria.
* **Parallel Execution:** Run multiple agents concurrently.
* **External Integrations:** Connect DeepAgents to other systems and APIs.

## Example Workflow

Let's say you want to automate the process of collecting news articles on a specific topic, summarizing them, and storing them in a database.  A DeepAgents workflow might look like this:

1. **News Article Collector Agent:** Collects articles from various news sources.
2. **Article Summarizer Agent:** Summarizes each collected article.
3. **Database Storage Agent:** Stores the articles and summaries in a database.

This workflow would involve defining the data flow between agents (articles from the collector to the summarizer, summaries from the summarizer to the storage agent), and implementing error handling to manage situations where a news source is unavailable or an article cannot be summarized.
