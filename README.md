**LangCode** is an experimental AI coding agent that operates directly in your terminal. It uses a ReAct-style loop with a curated set of tools to understand your codebase, plan changes, and execute them safely. It can help you implement features, fix bugs, or just chat about your code.

## Features

-   **🤖 Interactive Chat:** Have a conversation with the agent about your project.
-   **✨ Feature Implementation:** Describe a new feature, and the agent will plan and implement it.
--  **🐞 Bug Fixes:** Provide a bug description or a stack trace, and the agent will diagnose and patch the code.
-   **🛠️ Tool-Based:** Uses a set of tools for file system operations, code editing, and running commands.
-   **🔒 Safe by Default:** Requires your confirmation before applying any file edits or running any commands. Use the `--apply` flag to override.
-   **🧠 Multi-Provider:** Supports multiple LLM providers (currently Anthropic and Google Gemini).

## Installation

First, ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer. You can install LangCode using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain-code
```

## Configuration

The agent requires API keys for the desired LLM provider. It loads these from a `.env` file in your project directory.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

2.  Add your API keys to the file. For example:
    ```env
    # For Anthropic Claude
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

    # For Google Gemini
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
    ```

The agent will automatically detect which provider to use based on the available environment variables. You can also explicitly choose a provider with the `--llm` option.

## Usage

The main entry point is the `langcode` command, which has three sub-commands: `chat`, `feature`, and `fix`.

### `langcode chat`

Opens an interactive session to chat with the agent about your project.

**Usage:**
```bash
langcode chat [OPTIONS]
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Start a chat session in the current directory
langcode chat

# Specify a different project directory
langcode chat --project-dir /path/to/your/project

# Explicitly choose the LLM provider
langcode chat --llm gemini
```

### `langcode feature`

Implements a new feature from a single request. The agent will plan the changes, write the code, and optionally run tests to verify it.

**Usage:**
```bash
langcode feature [OPTIONS] <REQUEST>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Request a new feature
langcode feature "Add a dark mode toggle in the settings panel"

# Provide a test command to verify the implementation
langcode feature "Add a /health endpoint" --test-cmd "pytest -q"

# Allow the agent to apply edits and run commands without confirmation
langcode feature "Refactor the user model to use UUIDs" --apply
```

### `langcode fix`

Diagnoses and fixes a bug. You can describe the bug or provide a log file with a stack trace.

**Usage:**
```bash
langcode fix [OPTIONS] [REQUEST]
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Describe the bug to fix
langcode fix "The login button is not working on the main page"

# Provide an error log file for context
langcode fix --log "errors.log"

# Combine a description with a log file
langcode fix "Fix the crash on image upload" --log "upload-crash.log"

# Run tests to verify the fix
langcode fix "Fix the off-by-one error in pagination" --test-cmd "npm test"
```
